This location search feature is provided by Microsoft Bing.<br><br></li>

<br><br>
In some viewers, a "Pick a town" tool may be available. Type a municipality name into the "Pick a town" box. You may also type just the first part of a town name. For example, to see a list of municipalities that begin with "Sa," type "Sa" into the box. Click the town name of interest. The map will zoom to the extent of the selected municipality. Other variations of this tool, such as "Pick a school," may be available.
