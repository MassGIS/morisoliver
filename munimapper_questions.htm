<strong class="bold">Troubleshooting</strong><br>
If the map does not initially load in Internet Explorer, go to the "Tools" menu and click "Internet Options." Click on the "Security" tab and click the button "Default level." Click the "Apply" button and the "OK" button and then reload the MORIS page.
<br><br>
<strong class="bold">Errors Drawing Data Layers</strong><br>
If there is an error drawing a data layer, the data layer's icon in the "Active Data Layers" window will have a red exclamation point. This red exclamation point indicates that the data layer is currently unavailable; this may be due to an internet connection or a web services problem. Changing the map extent (e.g., panning), adding data layers, etc., will cause the data link to be refreshed. If this connection is restored, the red exclamation point will go away.
