<strong class="subhead"><a name="identify" id="identify">Parcel Data Filter Tool</a></strong>

<ol>

MuniMapper allows the user to filter the parcel data by town or multiple towns, property type, total value (land + bldg.), bldg. value, last sale date, last sale price and lot size.  Once the database is filtered, all of the candidates meeting your criteria will be displayed along with all of the assessors data attributes, not just the filter options. 
<br><br>

With consultation with MassGIS, the filter tool can be customized to use any of the fields in the parcel database or for any of the other layers.
<br><br>
1. The Filter will take your geographic area into account.  If you wish to query parcels that are within the map extent you are at, just start using the Filter Builder tool and under Town select ALL. However, if you wish to filter parcels by a subarea as well, first zoom in to your area of interest using any of the zoom methods previously described.  
<br><br>

2. Once the map shows your geographic area of interest click on the Filter tool dropdown that looks like a funnel  <img src="img/filter.png" alt="Filter tool" border="0"></li> and choose "Launch filter builder". 
<br><br>
3. Examine the dialog box for the filter tool:

<br><br>
<img src="img/munimapper_filter1.jpg" alt="Filter 1" border="0">

<br><br>
Currently it has been set up so that Town and property type are required (note the asterisk * which is the normal indication of a required item on the web) and all of the other fields are optional. You will need to be familiar with the Property type use codes for your particular town(s). The Dept. of Revenue maintains a list of standardized codes at http://www.mass.gov/dor/docs/dls/bla/classificationcodebook.pdf  However, some towns use these codes, or variations on these codes, or their own. In many towns (like Malden), use codes are accompanied by descriptive text.
<br><br>

More than one Town or Property type may be selected.  Just hold down the shift key to select an additional choice. Just remember the more you choose, the longer the process will take to return your results. 101 is normally the code for single family homes and 102 or a similar variation is a condominium.
<br><br>

4. In this example I will use the Pick a city/town dropdown to zoom directly to Malden and then search for single family properties sold between Jan. 1, 2010 and Dec. 31, 2010, with a sale price of between $350,000 and $500,000.  Once your query parameters are set, click the Apply button.
<br><br>

<br><br>
5. Then 2 things will happen: <br/> <br/>
a) The parcels that match your filter query will draw on the map.  Note: if you pan or zoom the map the parcels will stay (no additional parcels will appear until a new filter is done).  There is no limit to the amount of parcels that can draw. However, there is a 500 record limit to the number of tabular records that will be returned.
<br/><br/>
<img src="img/munimapper_filter3.jpg" alt="Filter 1" border="0">
<br/>
b) An Identify results window will appear showing the number of parcels that matched your filter query.

<br><br>

The Filter Builder box can be closed at any time to better see the map and reopened by clicking on the Filter button
<img src="img/filter.png" alt="Filter 1" border="0">
<br/> <br/>
6. If the number of parcels meeting your criteria is less than 500 you can then get a table of information for those parcels,
        which includes all of the fields in the assessors database.  Click on the row with the name
       Parcels Level 3 No Roads.  Underneath a Feature details section will appear:

<br><br>
<img src="img/munimapper_filter5.jpg" alt="Filter 5" border="0"><br/><br/>
This window and columns may be resized. Columns may be dropped and column values can be  sorted ascending or descending by using the dropdown that appears when you hover over the field names.  When the table opens, the parcels on the map are highlighted in orange.  If a row or rows in the table are selected in blue, the corresponding parcels on the map are highlighted in blue. Parcels on the map may also be clicked blue and will be highlighted in the table.   Hold down the shift key to select multiple rows or parcels.


<br/> <br/>
7. To do a new query just change your parameters in the Filter Builder dialog and click the Apply button again.  The Filter tool always keeps your last query, so the Filter Builder box can be closed at any time and reopened by clicking on the Filter button
<img src="img/filter.png" alt="Filter 5" border="0"><br/>
8. It is possible to bookmark your query map or send the URL to another person by using the Permalink tool .
<img src="img/12_permalink.png" alt="permalink" border="0"><br/>
      Click the yellow star and follow the instructions.  (Instructions are slightly different for different browsers.)
<br/> <br/>
9. You can print your query map and the printout will contain only the dots on the map that match the query filter.<br/> <br/>
10. You can extract the data of your query and the resulting shapefile or KML will only contain the parcels that match the query filter.<br/><br/>
11. If exported as a shapefile, one of the files contained in the export will have a .dbf extension. This file is the assessors table of your selected parcels.  While you do need GIS software to view a shapefile, you can view the .dbf in Excel or Access.

NOTE: The filter is still in place if the Parcel Data Filter tool is selected (a box is drawn around the tool).  While the filter is automatically cleared when the Abutters List tool is selected, otherwise the filter stays.  If you want to clear the filter, choose the tool dropdown and choose "Clear filter" and the tool will be unselected.  This is important for performing a right-click simple identify on the laeyr after doing a filter.
