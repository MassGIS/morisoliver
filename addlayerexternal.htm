<li>A pop-up window will appear with a table of the available external data sources. Click on an external source name in the "Sources" table to view its available data layers.<br><br></li>

<li>A list of the available data layers provided by the selected external source will appear in the "Data layers" table. Click the arrow to the right of a column name to sort the columns in ascending or descending order or to turn on or off a column. To add a data layer to the map, double-click a data layer row, or right-click a data layer row and select "Add layer(s)." To add more than one data layer, hold the Shift or Ctrl key on your keyboard to highlight multiple rows, right-click, and select "Add layer(s)." The "Add selected" button may also be clicked to add the selected data layers, and the "Add all" button may be clicked to add all the data layers listed in the "Data layers" table.

<p><strong class="bold">Please note:</strong> Data layers from external sources can be added to your map for display only. You will not be able to use the identify, permalink, print, or export tools with these data layers, nor will you be able to view their metadata or change their symbology. External data layers may not draw if you have a large monitor with a high-resolution screen display. If the external data layer does not draw, please make the browser window smaller. The legend of external data layers may also get cut off.</p>
