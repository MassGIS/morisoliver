</p>
<p>Some versions of MORIS allow points, lines, and polygons to be edited live. Typically those versions will ask for a username and password to verify permission to perform edits.</p>
<p><strong class="bold">Drawing New Features</strong><br></p>

<ol>
<li>Click the "Draw New Feature" tool to view a menu of data layers that may be edited.<br><br></li>

<li>Select one of the listed data layers to which to add a feature (there may be one or more data layer choices).<br><br></li>

<li>Click on the map to start drawing the feature.<br><br></li>

<li>In some applications snapping to features and splitting (of lines) may be enabled. In that case, a prompt will ask you to draw a box to indicate the snapping area.<br><br></li>

<li>If drawing a point feature, click once on the map to draw the new feature. If drawing a line or polygon feature, click more than once on the map to mark out the vertices of your line or polygon and double-click to finish drawing. Once you have finished drawing your new feature, the attribute editing window (titled WFSTFeatureEditing) will appear.<br><br></li>

<li>If snapping or splitting is available, it is configured specifically for each application. Consult the more detailed instructions provided. As a general note, snapping can happen to more than one data layer, including the data layer being edited. Snapping will occur even if the data layer being snapped to is not drawn on the map. Snapping will occur to both lines and vertices. However, features that are selected by this drawn rectangle are used in their entirety. Currently it is possible to split only lines with lines. When approaching a data layer feature to which it is possible to snap you will sense a bit of "stickiness"&mdash;the vertex will seem to jump slightly to match up to the line or vertex.<br><br></li>

<li>Enter values for the attribute fields. Click the "Save" button in the lower right of the attribute editing window when done. If you wish to cancel adding a feature, click the "Cancel" button in the lower right of the attribute editing window.<br><br></li>

<li>The new feature will immediately appear on the map.<br><br>

<p><strong class="bold">Editing Existing Features</strong><br></p>

<ol>

<li>Click the "Edit Existing Feature" tool to view a menu of data layers that may be edited.<br><br></li>

<li>Select one of the listed data layers to edit from the menu (there may be one or more data layer choices).<br><br></li>

<li>Draw a box on the map to select a feature to edit. Features within or overlapping that box will be selected. You may zoom in or out while features are selected.<br><br></li>

<li>If more than one feature was selected, choose one feature within the attribute editing window. (Only one feature may be edited at a time.) The selected feature will turn blue and have orange vertices.<br><br></li>

<li>You may move the feature, change its shape, or change its attributes. To move the feature, click on the vertex (orange dot) closest to the center of the feature and drag. You should see the blue feature with orange vertices move, while the original feature stays. If you decide to save, the original feature will disappear. To reshape the feature, click on a vertex (orange dot) and drag it. You will see the blue feature change shape. To add vertices, click on a vertex that is not on a corner and drag it slightly. A new vertex to both sides will be created.<br><br></li>

<li>If drawing a point feature, after one click the attribute editing window (titled WFSTFeatureEditing) will appear. If drawing a line or polygon feature, click more than once on the map to mark out the vertices of your line or polygon and double-click to finish drawing.<br><br></li>

<li>Change any values for the attribute fields. Click the "Save" button in the lower right of the attribute editing window when done. If you wish to cancel editing a feature, click the "Cancel" button in the lower right of the attribute editing window.<br><br></li>

<li>The edited feature will immediately appear on the map.<br><br>
The current editing attributes system is basic. Enhancements such as mandatory fields, restricted fields and dropdown values are planned.<br><br>

<p><strong class="bold">Comment Tool</strong><br></p>

<p>There is a "Comment" tool option that allows a point to be entered into a data layer with attributes. The points may only be entered, not edited.</p>
