<br><br>
This user guide was written using a Windows PC. Below are some tips for using MORIS on a Mac.
<br><br>
<strong class="bold">Right-Clicking</strong><br>
Some of the tools and menus are accessed by right-clicking (e.g., to zoom to the extent of a data layer, right-click the data layer name in the "Active Data Layers" window and select "Zoom to layer"). If your Mac mouse has one button, you may right-click by holding down the Control key and then clicking with the mouse.
<br><br>
<strong class="bold">Highlighting Multiple Rows</strong><br>
To highlight multiple rows, hold the Shift or Command key on your keyboard and then click the rows of interest. After identifying features, users may highlight multiple rows in the "Feature details" table in the "Identify results" pop-up window. Users may also remove more than one data layer from the "Selected data layers" table in the "Data export wizard" by highlighting multiple rows. 
<br><br>
<strong class="bold">Saving a Map Image</strong><br>
To insert an image of the map into other documents, capture a screenshot of the map. Click Command-Shift-4 on your keyboard, then the space bar, then click a window to save an image file of the selected window on the desktop. Click Command-Control-Shift-4 on your keyboard, then the space bar, then click a window to copy an image of the selected window to your clipboard. This image can be pasted into another software program, such as Microsoft Word.
