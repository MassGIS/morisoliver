Getting morisoliver to work out-of-the-box.

* helper_scripts_distribute/slice_getcaps.pl
  * Change $dest_dir to a working www-accessible dir on your box.
  * Run the script
    cd helper_scripts_districute
    ./slice_getcaps.pl
  * In your $dest_dir you should see a lot of .xml files and one .js file.

* Assuming you are trying to launch oliver.php, make sure that the references
  to OL_MORIS_cache match what you setup in slice_getcaps.pl above.

* Still assuming we're in oliver.php, the proxyLoc needs to be on YOUR SERVER and
  NOT left as http://maps.massgis.state....

# oliver.php again, you need to bring over a LOCAL copy of the folderset.xml and
  reference it w/ foldersetLoc.
