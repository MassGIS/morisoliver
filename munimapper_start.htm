The MuniMapper application uses a custom MassGIS Statewide Basemap combined with three other cached tiled layers named "Tax Parcels", "Structures" and "Detailed Features".  These layers are designed to draw very fast.  An aerial photo can be substituted underneath the "Tax Parcels", "Structures" and "Detailed Features" tiled layers by using the Basemaps menu in the bottom right of the MuniMapper application.  "Tax Parcels", "Structures" and "Detailed Features" can also be found in the "Tiled Layers" folder in the upper right Available Data Layers area.  Two addition layers are added initially to the map "Tax Parcels for Query" and "Roads for Query".  These are layers without color that the identify tool will use (hence "for Query") since the cache tiled layers are only static pictures.  If any local data was provided by the municipality it will be found in the top folder of the Available Data Layers area.
