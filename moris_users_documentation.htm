MORIS, the Massachusetts Ocean Resource Information System, is an online mapping tool created by the <a href="http://www.mass.gov/czm/" title="Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management">Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management</a> (CZM), the <a href="http://www.mass.gov/mgis/" title="Massachusetts Office of Geographic Information">Massachusetts Office of Geographic Information</a> (MassGIS), the <a href="http://www.massoceanpartnership.org/" title="Massachusetts Ocean Partnership">Massachusetts Ocean Partnership</a> (MOP), and <a href="http://www.asascience.com/" title="Applied Science Associates">Applied Science Associates</a> (ASA). MORIS can be used to search and display spatial data pertaining to the Massachusetts coastal zone. Users can interactively view various data layers, create and share maps, and download the data for use in a Geographic Information System (GIS). MORIS connects to MassGIS' GeoServer-based <a href="http://lyceum.massgis.state.ma.us/wiki/doku.php" title="web mapping service">web mapping service</a>.
<br><br>
<blockquote><strong class="bold">Please note:</strong> <small>MORIS is one of a family of applications, all built on the same template. Some of the other versions include OLIVER (the MassGIS Online Data Viewer) and SPOLIVER (the State Police Online Data Viewer). This user guide applies to all of these applications, so you may substitute OLIVER, SPOLIVER, etc. for MORIS as you read this guide.</small></blockquote>

<strong class="bold">What do I need to run MORIS?</strong><br>
MORIS is run through a web browser. At this time, the application fully works in Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox and has some limited functionality in other web browsers. The latest versions of both Internet Explorer and Firefox are recommended. Currently Internet Explorer 8 and Firefox 3.6.13 have been thoroughly tested, but the application also works in Internet Explorer 6 and 7 and Firefox 3.0 and above.
<br><br>
To start MORIS, go to <a href="http://www.mass.gov/czm/mapping/index.htm" title="MORIS">http://www.mass.gov/czm/mapping/index.htm</a>. Select "Yes" if you accept and agree to the terms and would like to view the online maps.

<ol>
<li>Browse folders in the "Available data layers" window for data layers.<br><br></li>

<li>Double-click a data layer name to add it to the legend, or right-click a data layer name and select "Add layer."<br><br></li>

<li>The data layer is drawn on the map. The data layer name will appear in the "Active data layers" window and the legend of the data layer will be added to the "Active data legends" window.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong class="bold">Please note:</strong> If there is an error drawing a data layer, the data layer's icon in the "Active data layers" window will have a red exclamation point. This red exclamation point indicates that the data layer is currently unavailable; this may be due to an internet connection or web services problem. Changing the map extent (e.g., panning), adding data, etc. will cause the data link to be refreshed. If this connection is restored, the red exclamation point will go away.</p>

<strong class="subhead"><a name="addlayersearch" id="addlayersearch">Adding Data Layers by Searching</a></strong>
<ol>
<li>Type a search term in the box. The application searches data layer names.<br><br></li>

<p>
<strong class="subhead"><a name="scale" id="scale">Data Layers with Scale Dependencies</a></strong>
</p>
<p>
Most data layers are visible at all scales, but some data layers have scale dependencies and are only visible within certain scale ranges, such as greater than 1:1,000. If a data layer has a scale dependency and the map is not within the appropriate scale range, the data layer will not draw on the map and its icon in the "Active data layers" window will have a yellow exclamation point. Hover the mouse over the yellow exclamation point to see the range within which the data layer will draw. To view the data layer, zoom in or out to a map scale within the available scale range.
</p>

<p>
<strong class="subhead"><a name="reorder" id="reorder">Reordering Data Layers</a></strong>

<p>
<strong class="subhead"><a name="download" id="download">Downloading Data</a></strong>

<ol>
<li>Click the "Export data" tool.<br><br></li>

<li>The "Data export wizard" will appear in a pop-up window. Read the welcome paragraph and click "Next" to continue.<br><br></li>

<li>Data layers from the "Active data layers" window will appear in "Data layers of interest." One or more individual data layers can be removed from this list by clicking the data layer name in the "Data layers of interest" table, right-clicking, and selecting "Remove layer(s)." Use the Ctrl button on your keyboard to select additional data layers to remove. To remove all data layers, click "Remove all." Additional data layers not present on the current map can be added by using the "Advanced - Select additional data layers" drop-down menu.<br><br></li>

<li>Click "Next" to export data that are within or overlap the current map window extent. Click "Advanced - Change area of interest" to change the area of interest. If changing the area of interest, select the units you would like to use (i.e., Massachusetts State Plane meters, decimal degrees, or degrees, minutes, and seconds). Then enter the Min X, Min Y, Max X, and Max Y coordinates you want to use to define your area of interest. If you prefer to go back to the original extent instead, select the "Import active map's bounding box" button to import the current map extent. Click "Next" to continue. <br><br></li>

<li>The "Query results" table lists the data layers for export and the number of features found for each data layer within your area of interest. A green check mark indicates that the data layer is okay to export. A red "X" indicates that the data layer will not download because zero features or greater than the maximum number of features allowed for download were found within your area of interest. Click "Next" to proceed.<br><br></li>
 
<li>Select the output coordinate system for the data you are going to export. The default system is MA State Plane Mainland NAD83 (m) - EPSG:26986.<br><br></li>

<li>Select your preferred data output. The default format is ESRI shapefile (.shp) for vector data. Also available is Keyhole Markup Language (.kml). Please note that GIS data are not stored in the export KML files. Instead, a URL for MassGIS web services is embedded in each KML. MassGIS web services will retrieve the data specified when you open the KML in Google Earth. For raster data, the GeoTiff radio button will be selected by default, as this is the only raster format available at this time. Click "Next" to continue.<br><br></li>

<li>You have the option of downloading everything as one ZIP file or of downloading individual data layers. If downloading everything as one ZIP file, click the "Download everything as one ZIP file" button, enter a name for the ZIP file, click "Download file," click the blue "here," and follow your browser instructions for saving the file. To download individual data layers, click the "Advanced - Download individual layers" drop-down menu. Click on the download link next to a data layer's name to download that data layer's shapefile. Click on the other download links below the data layer's name to download the associated files (e.g., HTML metadata file, XML metadata file, symbology file, etc.). Follow your browser instructions to save the file to the desired directory.<br><br></li>

<li>Click "Finish" to close the data export wizard.

</p>
<p>
There is currently no sophisticated print option. Printing from the browser is possible using the "File" menu and "Print" option. Use "Print Preview" to see the expected result. Choosing landscape orientation will work best. The three windows to the right of the map may be adjusted in size to, for example, make the legend area larger.

<strong class="bold">Troubleshooting</strong><br>
If the map does not initially load in Internet Explorer, go to the "Tools" menu and click "Internet Options." Click on the "Security" tab and click the button "Default level." Click the "Apply" button and the "OK" button and then reload the MORIS page.
<br><br>
<strong class="bold">Errors Drawing Data Layers</strong><br>
If there is an error drawing a data layer, the data layer's icon in the "Active data layers" window will have a red exclamation point. This red exclamation point indicates that the data layer is currently unavailable; this may be due to an internet connection or web services problem. Changing the map extent (e.g., panning), adding data, etc. will cause the data link to be refreshed. If this connection is restored, the red exclamation point will go away.
