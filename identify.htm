<ol>
<li>Click the "Identify features by clicking a point or drawing a box" tool or the "Identify features by drawing a polygon" tool.<br><br></li>

<li>If using the "Identify features by clicking a point or drawing a box" tool, click on the map to identify features of active data layers that intersect the location you clicked, or click on the map, hold down the mouse button, and drag to draw a box to identify features of active data layers located within the box. This box will appear red as you draw it. If using the "Identify features by drawing a polygon" tool, click on the map to draw vertices of a polygon, and double-click to finish drawing the polygon to identify features of active data layers located within or overlapping the polygon. The polygon will appear red as you draw it.<br><br></li>

<li>A pop-up window will appear with the identify results. Data layers from external sources cannot be queried, so they will not be included in the results. You may view the attributes for up to 2,000 features per data layer. If identifying on a raster data layer, the raster's cell value in the center of the identify box or polygon will be found. Please note that some data layers have scale dependencies and are only visible within certain scale ranges, such as less than 1:100,000. If a data layer has a scale dependency and the map is not within the appropriate scale range, then the data layer will not draw on the map, its icon in the "Active Data Layers" window will have a yellow exclamation point, and it cannot be identified. Please see the Help section on "Data Layers with Scale Dependencies" for more information on how to view data layers with scale dependencies. Once data layers with scale dependencies are visible, they may be queried.<br><br></li>

<li>To view the feature details of a point, line, or polygon data layer, click on the data layer name in the "Data layers" table. Attributes for the selected data layer will appear in the "Feature details" table and the features will be highlighted in orange on the map. Click the arrow to the right of a column name to sort the attributes in ascending or descending order or to turn on or off a column. If a row is selected in the table, the corresponding feature will be highlighted in blue on the map. Hold the Shift or Ctrl key to select multiple rows. The "Select all" button may also be clicked to select all the features. Additionally, you may click one of the orange highlighted features on the map to highlight it in blue and select its corresponding row in the "Feature details" table. Right-click a row in the "Feature details" table to zoom to a feature or clear a feature.
<br><br>
To view the identified cell value of a raster data layer, click on the raster data layer name in the "Data layers" table. A pop-up window will appear with the cell value and a red "X" will be drawn on the raster data layer cell that is being queried. Close the pop-up window to clear the red "X" from the map.
<br><br></li>

<li>You may also use the identify tools to select an area of interest for exporting data. To export data layers that are within or overlap the identify area (i.e., the identify point, box, or polygon), click the blue "here" at the top of the "Identify results" window to launch the data export wizard. To export data layers that are within or overlap a selected polygon feature, right-click the row of the feature of interest in the "Feature details" table and select "Launch the data export wizard and restrict the area of interest to this feature." Please note that this option is not available for point or line features. Please see the Help section on "Downloading Data" for more information on using the data export wizard.<br><br></li>

<li>Close the "Identify results" window to clear the identified features and red box from the map.<br><br>
