Currently it has been set up so that Town and property type are required (note the asterisk * which is the normal indication of a required item on the web) and all of the other fields are optional. You will need to be familiar with the Property type use codes for your particular town(s). The Dept. of Revenue maintains a list of standardized codes at http://www.mass.gov/dor/docs/dls/bla/classificationcodebook.pdf  However, some towns use these codes, or variations on these codes, or their own. In many towns (like Malden), use codes are accompanied by descriptive text. 
<br><br>

More than one Town or Property type may be selected.  Just hold down the shift key to select an additional choice. Just remember the more you choose, the longer the process will take to return your results. 101 is normally the code for single family homes and 102 or a similar variation is a condominium.
<br><br>

4. In this example I will use the Pick a city/town dropdown to zoom directly to Malden and then search for single family properties sold between Jan. 1, 2010 and Dec. 31, 2010, with a sale price of between $350,000 and $500,000.  Once your query parameters are set, click the Apply button.
