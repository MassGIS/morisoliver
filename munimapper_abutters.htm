<ol>
NOTE: The abutter list produced by the abutters list tool is not a certified list; a certified list can only be provided by the municipality. 
<br/><br/>MuniMapper allows the user to create an abutters list from the parcel data.  The abutters list will include the owner names and mailing addresses of the parcels with a certain configurable distance so that mailing labels can be created for a notification mailing.  

<br><br>
1. Click on the button that looks like an "i" with a small buffer around it <img src="img/11.5_buffer.png" alt="Abutters tool" border="0"> and dropdown to see the units.
<br/><br/>

<br><br>
2. Fill in the number of units and choose a type of unit.  For example, 50 feet or .5 mile.
<br><br>

<br><br>
3. With the mouse, draw a box to include one or more parcels to buffer for an abutters list.  Currently up to 3 parcels may be selected.  The parcels will be selected and buffered using the distance specified.  A dotted orange line will draw on the map to show the buffer line.
<br><br>

<br><br>
4. Currently parcels of POLY_TYPE="ROW" are automatically dropped from the initial selection (a message will indicate if any have been dropped).  
<br><br>
5. After the buffer has been calculated, the abutters parcels will be selected.  Currently parcels of POLY_TYPE="ROW" or POLY_TYPE="PRIV_ROW" will be dropped from the buffer results selection (the final abutters list) (a message will indicate if any have been dropped).
<br><br>

5. If too many abutters list parcels are been selected, right click a row and choose "Clear feature".
<br><br>

6. At the bottom left of the table choose "Save all records as.." dropdown to save the abutters list information as an Excel spreadsheet or CSV text file.
